# Fi Info
Having a Project Fi Sim card?

&#8226; Fi Info allows you to see and keep track of which network you're connected to (WiFi, Sprint, T-Mobile), and at which speed (2G, 3G, 4G).

&#8226; Events recorded:
- phone shutdown
- phone boot up
- connecting to WiFi
- connecting to GSM
- change of speed while on GSM

&#8226; Notifications will be triggered for any WiFi / GSM event.

&#8226; PR welcome (especially design :)
